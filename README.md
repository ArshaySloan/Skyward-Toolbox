# Skyward-Toolbox
List of useful scripts for Skyward Finance and Student systems.

Few items to take into consideration.  A lot of the SQL written here is for a
MSSQL Database connected to Skywards native Progress Database via ODBC. Skyward
offers ODBC drivers you will just have to contact their support center.

The name [SKYWARD FINANCE] and [SKYWARD STUDENT] are the link alias used in my
environment.  Your most likely will differ!
